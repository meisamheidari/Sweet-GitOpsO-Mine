# Sweet-GitOpsO-Mine
# GitOps solution design for a multi-cluster microservices platform

## Context & scope

This design proposes a pragmatic GitOps workflow to deploy a multi-service application to Kubernetes across **dev**, **staging**, and **prod** stages and across multiple locations. It follows the case brief’s expectations on repo design, multiple stages, CI/CD interactions with the GitOps tool, multi-cluster scaling, monitoring, and rollback. Where details were ambiguous, I’ve made explicit, reasonable assumptions and called them out.

---

## 1) Repository strategy

We use a **mono-repo** with two top-level roots:

```bash
Sweet-GitOpsO-Mine/
├─ .github/workflows/
│  ├─ ci-promote-to-dev.yaml
│  ├─ promote.yaml
│  └─ rollback.yaml
├─ app-code/
│  ├─ microservices/
│  │  ├─ microservice-a/
│  │  │  ├─ src/...
│  │  │  ├─ Dockerfile
│  │  │  └─ tests/
│  │  └─ microservice-b/ ...
│  └─ charts/ # Helm charts (one per microservice; optional library chart)
└─ gitops-repo/
   ├─ argocd/
   │  ├─projects/
   │  │  └─ default-project.yaml
   │  ├─ applicationsets/
   │  │  ├─ app-service.yaml # per-service apps across clusters
   │  │  └─ platform.yaml # platform add-ons across clusters
   │  └─ root-apps.yaml # bootstrap (app-of-apps)
   ├─ dev/
   │  ├─ app-service/ # values & manifests for services
   │  └─ platform/ # Argo Rollouts, kube-prometheus-stack, etc.
   ├─ staging/
   │  ├─ app-service/
   │  └─ platform/
   └─ prod/
      ├─ cluster-a/
      │  ├─ app-service/
      │  └─ platform/
      └─ cluster-b/ ...
```

### Key points

- **`app-code`**: source, tests, Dockerfiles, and per-service Helm charts in `/microservices` and `/charts`. 
- **`gitops-repo`**: Argo CD declarative state.  
  - `argocd/projects/default-project.yaml` restricts allowed repos, destinations, and namespaces.  
  - `argocd/applicationsets/*.yaml` defines **ApplicationSets** that fan-out apps to the right clusters/locations via labels.  
  - `root-apps.yaml` is an **app-of-apps** for bootstrapping Argo CD and the base platform.  
  - `dev|staging|prod` folders hold **environment-scoped** app/platform overlays.  
- **Multi-cluster**: Clusters are registered in Argo CD and **labeled**, e.g. `stage=prod`, `location=eu-central`. ApplicationSets select clusters by these labels, so **prod may span more clusters than dev/staging** without forcing non-prod everywhere.

---

## 2) Environments & multi-cluster expansion

- **Stages**: `dev` (fast feedback), `staging` (pre-prod validation), `prod` (potentially many clusters/locations).
- **Clusters**: At least one cluster per stage; **prod** may have multiple (e.g., `prod-eu1`, `prod-us1`, `prod-ap1`).  
- **Argo CD ApplicationSet (cluster generator)** filters clusters by labels:
  - Dev deploys to clusters labeled `stage=dev`.
  - Staging deploys to clusters labeled `stage=staging`.
  - Prod deploys to **all** clusters labeled `stage=prod`, regardless of location.
- **Config drift prevention**: Argo CD with **auto-sync + prune** (configurable per env) keeps live state equal to `gitops-repo`.

---

## 3) CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions)

We implement **three workflows** to cover CI, promotions, and rollbacks.

### 3.1 `ci-promote-to-dev.yaml` (CI + auto PR to dev)

**Trigger:** push/PR to `app-code/microservices/<service>/` or a tag (e.g., `service-A-v1.4.2`).

**Steps (per service):**
1. **Build & test**: Lint, unit/integration tests.
2. **Container build**: Build image with labels (git SHA, version), push to registry (e.g., GHCR).
3. **Security gates**: SAST, dependency and image scanning (e.g., CodeQL, Trivy).
4. **Update GitOps**:  
   - Bump the **image tag** in `gitops-repo/dev/<cluster>/app/values.yaml`.  
   - Open an **automatic PR** to `gitops-repo` with a conventional commit message (e.g., `feat(service-A): dev-> image v1.4.2 (sha abc123)`).
5. **Auto-merge** (dev only): If checks pass & required reviewers (dev owners) approve, merge the PR.

**CD effect:** Post-merge, **Argo CD detects Git change** and reconciles the dev environment.

### 3.2 `promote.yaml` (manual promotion to staging/prod)

**Trigger:** `workflow_dispatch` with inputs:
- `version` (tag/SHA), `target_env` (`staging` or `prod`), optional `location` filter for prod, and `strategy` (e.g., `canary10-30-60`, `bluegreen`).

**Steps:**
1. **Validate artifact**: Check that the image/tag exists and was tested in dev.
2. **Prepare change**: Update `gitops-repo/<env>/<cluster>/app/values.yaml` with the chosen image tag and rollout strategy parameters (traffic steps, analysis templates).
3. **Create PR**: Assign to environment **CODEOWNERS** (SRE/Platform for prod), require **approval**.
4. **Post-merge gates**:  
   - **Staging**: Auto-sync; Argo Rollouts runs a short canary with automated **Prometheus-based Analysis**.  
   - **Prod**: Auto-sync to all selected prod clusters with **progressive delivery**. Each step can require a **manual gate** (Argo Rollouts pause) for human approval if desired.

### 3.3 `rollback.yaml` (git-revert per stage)

**Trigger:** `workflow_dispatch` with inputs: `env`, `to_revision` (optional).

**Approach:**
- **Git revert** the last “promote” commit in `gitops-repo/<env>/<cluster>/app/<service>`, or set the image tag back to a **known-good** version.
- Open PR → fast-track approval for emergencies.
- Merge → Argo CD reconciles → **Argo Rollouts** aborts canary (if ongoing) and promotes **stable** (previous ReplicaSet) automatically; or the straight deployment rolls back to the reverted tag.

---

## 4) How GitOps CD works after promotions

1. A promotion PR merges to `gitops-repo` (env folder).
2. Argo CD notices the change via its repo watcher and **compares desired vs live state**.
3. With **auto-sync** enabled, Argo CD applies the diff to the destination cluster(s).
4. If the workload uses **Argo Rollouts**, the Rollout resource orchestrates traffic shifting.  
   - **AnalysisTemplates** run Prometheus queries to judge success.  
   - On success, traffic increments; on failure, it auto-aborts and reverts to the stable ReplicaSet.  
5. **Monitoring** (Prometheus/Grafana) and **alerts** inform operators; **manual gates** (pauses) can be required in staging/prod.

---

## 5) Scaling within and across clusters

- **Intra-cluster scaling**:  
  - **HPA** on CPU, memory, or **custom metrics** via Prometheus Adapter.  
  - Optionally **VPA** for right-sizing.  
  - Cluster Autoscaler enabled on node groups.
- **Cross-cluster scaling** (prod):  
  - **ApplicationSet** deploys the same service across multiple prod clusters/locations.  
  - **Traffic steering**: via global DNS/anycast LB or a multi-cluster ingress/controller (cloud-agnostic assumption).  
  - Safe deployments using **Rollouts** per cluster; roll back cluster-by-cluster if needed.

---

## 6) Observability & monitoring

We standardize on **Prometheus Operator stack** (commonly shipped via the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart) plus Grafana.

**How we use them:**
- Platform **ApplicationSet** deploys the operator stack to each cluster.
- Teams define **ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor** for each service; scrape labels live in the service Helm chart.
- **PrometheusRule** encapsulates SLOs and error-budget alerts (env-specific thresholds via values files).
- **Grafana** dashboards are templated per service; provisioned via ConfigMaps or Grafana Operator.
- **Argo Rollouts** integrates with Prometheus via **AnalysisTemplates**, enabling automated canary decisions during promotions.

---

## 7) Argo CD object model

- **Project**: `default-project.yaml` restricts:
  - **Source repos**: `repo-root/gitops-repo` (+ optional read-only app-code chart path).
  - **Destinations**: `namespace allowlists` per stage; `cluster allowlists` by label.
  - **RBAC**: developer access in dev, SRE ownership in prod.
- **ApplicationSets**:
  - `platform.yaml`: deploys platform components (Argo Rollouts, Prometheus stack, Grafana) into each cluster that meets capability labels.
  - `app-service.yaml`: one generator per service family; expands per **cluster label** and **stage**, pointing to the right `dev|staging|prod/app-service/...` path.
- **Bootstrap**: `root-apps.yaml` (app-of-apps) installs Projects, ApplicationSets, and baseline namespaces/CRDs first.

## 8) Tool choices — why these?

### Why **GitHub Actions** for CI (vs GitLab CI or Jenkins)
- **Tight GitHub integration**: native triggers on PRs, checks, environments, and CODEOWNERS; no extra connectors.  
- **Low ops overhead**: fully managed runners + optional self-hosted for privileged jobs; no Jenkins controller/agents to maintain.  
- **Security**: built-in OIDC for cloud auth (no long-lived secrets), fine-grained repo/environment protections.  
- **Ecosystem**: rich marketplace, reusable workflows, caches, and matrices reduce boilerplate.  
*GitLab CI is excellent when GitLab is your VCS; Jenkins remains powerful but increases operational burden for this scope.*

### Why **Argo CD** (vs Flux CD)
- **Best-in-class UI** for drift/health, diffs, rollbacks, and app topology—crucial for multi-cluster ops.  
- **ApplicationSet** and **App-of-Apps** patterns are first-class, simplifying our fan-out model.  
- **Strong Rollouts integration** and health checks.  
- **RBAC/Projects** offer clear multi-tenant guardrails.  
*Flux is composable and GitOps-Toolkit-driven, but requires more assembly and lacks Argo’s operational UI depth.*

### Why **Helm** (vs Kustomize)
- **Templating power** (functions, conditionals) for complex microservices and platform add-ons.  
- **Packaging & reuse** with charts, subcharts, and a consistent values interface for teams.  
- **Ecosystem**: many upstream components (Prometheus stack, Argo Rollouts, ingress controllers) ship Helm-first.  
*Kustomize overlays are elegant for small variances; we can still layer light Kustomize around generated manifests if needed.*

### Why **Prometheus & Grafana**
- **CNCF-standard, vendor-neutral** metrics stack that scales horizontally.  
- **Prometheus Operator CRDs** give declarative service discovery and alerting; **Grafana** provides flexible, versioned dashboards.  
- **Tight integration** with Argo Rollouts for data-driven canaries and with HPA via custom metrics.

## Appendix — mapping back to the brief

- **Repo design**: mono-repo with `app-code` and `gitops-repo` plus Helm charts and Argo CD objects.  
- **Multiple stages**: dev/staging/prod with per-stage values and folders.  
- **CI/CD & GitOps interaction**: Actions create PRs to GitOps; Argo CD reconciles post-merge.  
- **Scaling across clusters/locations**: ApplicationSet fan-out + HPA and traffic steering.  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus Operator stack and Grafana with CRDs named above.  
- **Rollbacks**: git revert + Argo CD + Argo Rollouts stable fallback.
